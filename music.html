            <h2> Previous Research </h2> 
            <p> -Doctors at Johns Hopkins recommend that you listen to music to stimulate your brain (Wilson, 2020).</p>
            <p> -Neurological researchers have found that listening to music triggers the release of several neurochemicals that play a role in brain function and mental health: dopamine( a chemical associated with pleasure and “reward” centers, stress hormones like cortisol, serotonin and other hormones related to immunity, and oxytocin (a chemical that fosters the ability to connect to others) (Chanda & Levitin, 2013).</p>
            <p> -Some studies suggest that music therapy can improve the quality of life and social connectedness for people with schizophrenia (Geretsegger et al. 2017). </p>
            <p> -A 2017 research review concluded that listening to music, particularly classical combined with jazz, had a positive effect on depression symptoms, especially when there were several listening sessions conducted by board certified music therapists (Leubner & Hinterberger 2017). One study that measured several indicators of stress (not just cortisol) concluded that while listening to music before a stressful event doesn’t reduce anxiety, listening to relaxing music after a stressful event can help your nervous system recover faster (Thoma et al, 2013). </p>
