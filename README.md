# REEMA-MentalHealth
By: Corinna Chen and Rebecca Frieden 

## Introduction
Hello! I created this project with my partner Rebecca Frieden at Kode With Klossy! 

## Inspiration
We were inspired to make REEMA after combining our passions. Rebecca had an idea of doing a mental health project, while thought it would be fun to include animals and music.

## What it does
It is a one stop shop for mental health resources and information! 

## How we built it
- Collaborated via Repl.it
- Coded in HTML, CSS, and JS
- Organized ideas through Google Suite

## New Skill
   - I learned how to make my website compatible with most devices!
