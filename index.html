            <p class = "mentalHealth">Mental health is a big issues nowadays - especially in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic - and there is so much information online that it can be hard to navigate it all. Our goal is to destigmative mental health by providing accessible resources for those who need; we also wanted to simplify the information on the internet to make it less overwhelming for those who would like to reach out for help.  Many teens will not reach out for help because of the stigma and because they don't know where to start. Well, start here :) </p>

            <h1> Ending the Stigma</h1>
            <p class = "endStigma"> 
            Stigma is a risk factor leading to negative mental health outcomes. It is responsible for treatment seeking delays and reduces the likelihood that a mentally ill patient will receive adequate care. It is evident that delay due to stigma can have devastating consequences. Stigmatized individuals may experience isolation, depression, anxiety, or public embarrassment. Stopping stigma is important to making all communities and community members safer and healthier. Everyone can help reduce the stigma by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in their communities.

        <div class = "aboutUs" id = "content">
            <h1> About Us </h1> 
            <p class = "ourMission"> We believe it's extremely important to raise awarness for mental  as mental health awareness increases the chances for early intervention, which can result in a fast recovery. Awareness reduces negative adjectives that have been set to describe people with a metal illness. The stigma against mental illness and lack of mental health awareness worsens already existing mental health issues. With increased mental health awareness comes more support and care for those that need it. Although REEMA may sound like a strange name, here's what it means: Resources, Ending the Stigma, Exercise, Animals, and Music. Reema is also one of the names of the powerful and ancient hindu goddess Durga, a symbol of female power. </p>
