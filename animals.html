            <h2> Previous Research </h2>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> An emotional support animal (ESA) is just what it sounds like, a pet that provides emotional support. ESAs don’t need any special training, beyond the normal training a pet needs. Dogs and cats are the most common, but any domesticated animal can be an ESA. ESAs are covered under the Fair Housing Act. This allows people with an ESA to have their pet in their home even if there is a “no pet” policy. The law also prevents additional pet fees for ESAs. </p> 

                <p> Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets can increase fitness, lower stress, and bring happiness to their owners. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Pets are extremely beneficial to physical health and mental health. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. </p>

            <h2> Things to Consider </h2> 

            <p> While we would all like to have the pet of our dreams, we must consider which pet is right for us. Here are some questions you should as yourself: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>What does the pet eat?</li>
                <li>How much exercise does the pet need?</li>
                <li>How large will it become?</li>
                <li>How much exercise does the pet need?</li>
                <li>How much will it cost for veterinary care?</li>
                <li>How long will this animal live?</li>
                <li>What type of habitat does this pet need to be healthy?</li>
                <li>What type of habitat does this pet need to be healthy?</li>
                <li>What type of exercise does this pet need?</li>
                <li>Are there young children, older people, or people with weak immune systems who will care for or be around the pet?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> Notes From the CDC: </h3>

            <ol> 
                <li> Households with children 5 years of age and younger should not have pet reptiles (turtles, lizards, snakes), amphibians (frogs, toads), or backyard poultry because of the risk of serious illness from harmful germs spread between these animals and young children. </li>
                <li> People with weakened immune systems should take extra precautions when choosing and handling pets. Talk to your veterinarian for help picking the best pet. </li>
                <li> Pregnant women should avoid adopting a new cat or handling stray cats, especially kittens. Cats can carry a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis—a disease that can cause birth defects. If you are pregnant, you do not need to give up your current cat, but you should avoid changing cat litter. </li>
                <li> Pregnant women should avoid contact with pet rodents to prevent exposure to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which can cause birth defects. If you’re pregnant and have a pet rodent, avoid direct contact and have someone else clean its habitat. </li>
                <li> Keep wildlife in the wild! Animals may seem like they are abandoned but their parents are often near by. </li>
            </ol>

                <h3 class = 'animalLabel'> Pets are good for mental health! </h3>
                <ol> 
                    <li> Petting animals releases an automatic relaxation response. </li>
                    <li> Petting animals help the release of serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin- all hormones that can play a part in elevating moods. </li>
                    <li> Lowers anxiety and helps people relax. </li>
                    <li> Provides comfort. </li>
                    <li> Reduces loneliness. </li>
                    <li> Increases mental stimulation. </li>
                    <li> Can provide an escape or happy distraction. </li>
                    <li> Can act as catalysts in the therapy process. </li>
                    <li> May reduce the initial resistance that might accompany therapy. </li>
                </ol>

                <p> They make great conversation starters! Having a pet will make it easy to strike up conversation and create meaningful connections. They make amazing companions and are very loyal to their owners. </p>

                <h3 class = 'animalLabel'> Pets aren't for everyone! </h3>
                <p> Pets can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make us sick even when the pet appears healthy. </p>

                <h5> People at risk for getting Zoonotic diseases (diseases spread between animals and people): </h5>
                <li> Children 5 years of age and younger</li> 
                <li> people with weakened immune systems </li> 
                <li> people 65 years of age and older </li> 
                <li> Pregnant women </li> 

                <p> Having a pet can be pricey and high maintenance! Take into account initial costs and recurring expenses. </p>

            <h2> Where to Get Support Animals </h2>

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> Since, emotional support animals don't need additional training, you can adopt an emotional support like you normally would a pet! </p>

                <p> In order to get the benefits of an ESA, you will need a “prescription” from a mental health professional. This is basically just a signed letter stating that you have a mental health condition and that your pet helps you deal with it. Some landlords and airlines will accept a letter from a medical doctor, but usually it needs to be a therapist or a psychiatrist. </p>
